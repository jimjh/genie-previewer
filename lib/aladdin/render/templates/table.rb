    # Renders table problems marked up in JSON as HTML.
    #
    # The grid should be given as a 2-dimensional array that represents the
    # table to be filled in. +"?"+ is a special token used in the grid to
    # indicate cells that require student input.
    #
    # The answer should also be given as a 2-dimensional array. However, a
    # dummy token may be used in cells that do not require student input to
    # cut redundancy. In the example below, the +"-"+ token is used.
    #
    # @example
    #     {
    #       "format": "table",
    #       "question": "fill me in",
    #       "grid": [[0, "?", 2], [3, "?", 5]],
    #       "answer": [["-", 1, "-"],  ["-", 4, "-"]
    #     }
