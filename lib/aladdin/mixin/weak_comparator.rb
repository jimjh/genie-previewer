      # Compares +submitted+ against +saved+ and returns a simple diff. Assumes
      # that:
      # - +saved+ is a ruby-marshalled value that carries rich type information
      # - +submitted+ is a user-submitted value that is either a string or an
      #   hash
      #
      # === Booleans
      # If +saved+ is +true+, then it will accept any +submitted+ value that
      # begins with 'T' or 't'. Similarly, if +saved+ is +false+, then it will
      # accept any +submitted+ value that begins with 'F' or 'f'.
      #
      # === Numerics
      # If +saved+ is a numeric, then it will accept any +submitted+ value that
      # is numerically equivalent to +saved+. For example, if +saved+ is 0,
      # then +'0.0'+ and +'0'+ will both be accepted.
      #
